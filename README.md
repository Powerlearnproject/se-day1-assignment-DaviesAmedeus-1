Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a discipline of coming up with a useful software product. It involves systematic processes such as designing, development, testing, 
deploying and maintanance of that software product.

Impotance of Software Engineering in techlogy industry:
1. Software Engineering reduces complexity: This is in a way that some problems intended to be solved are complicated buth software engineering principles
   the complexity can chunked and problem to be solved step by step without confusion.
   
2. Handling 0f big projects: Since it is a discipline, its principle govern engineers on how to tackle huge projects since they require, management, resources and
to meet time lines. Software engineering provide us with skills on handling those kind of projects.

3. Minimizing Software Costs: A randomly developed software may increase it production due to failure discipline in program. The principles of engineering enable
the softwares to be maintained daily and scaled accordingly with the need. The ones which do to follow the principles may start all over again when they want to
add something new.

4. Quality Assurance: Software engineering ensures that the product produced is of high quality and meets the standards of being secure, reliable and perform well.

5. Scalability: Software engineering ensure the software products are scalable with time and demand without any failure.

6. Collaboration: Software engineering provide means of collaboration among engineers. The skills gained through the process are essential in building reliable softwares.

    


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestines in software engineeering:
1. Development of programming language: The first programming language was fortan since then different programming languages have been developed so that people could build softwares 
to solves diffferent life challenges, from medical fields, entertainment, ecomimic etc

2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline: Software engineering as a discpline has shaped developers to build products that are reliable, scallable and maintanable.
3. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
